# Authentication

This repository contains views for authentication and registration that are based on the Material UI examples provided at https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/v6.4.6/docs/data/material/getting-started/templates/.

## Default usernames

The application uses local storage for persisting logins. Therefore, each registration that is made on the test site, is only stored in that specific browser instance. There are two permanent default users that can be used during tests:

| Name  | Username          | Password                           |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Alice | alice@example.com | `}3jc\xJnQ=E=+Q_y/%Hd311bW#6{_Oyj` |
| Bob   | bob@example.com   | `nUL9zA3q=Nt7\N,0?CL&c74U,Ic)0)dN` |
